## How does AI work?

> As the hype around AI has accelerated, vendors have scrambled to promote how their products and services use AI. Often what they call AI is just a component of AI, like machine learning. AI requires a foundation of specialized hardware and software for writing and training machine learning algorithms. No programming language is synonymous with AI, but a few, including Python, R, and Java, are popular.
>
> In general, AI systems work by ingesting large amounts of labeled training data, analyzing the data for correlations and patterns, and using those patterns to make predictions about future states. In this way, a chatbot that receives examples of text chats can learn to produce realistic interactions with people, or an image recognition tool can learn to identify and describe objects in images by examining millions of examples.

> AI programming focuses on three cognitive skills: **learning, reasoning, and self-correction.**

---

* **Learning process:**

> This aspect of AI programming focuses on acquiring data and creating rules on how to turn data into actionable insights. Rules, called algorithms, provide computing devices with step-by-step instructions on how to perform a specific task.

---

* **Reasoning process:**

> This aspect of AI programming focuses on choosing the right algorithm to achieve the desired result.

---

* **Self-correction process:**

> This aspect of AI programming is designed to continually refine the algorithms and ensure that they provide the most accurate results possible.

---

## What are the advantages and disadvantages of artificial intelligence?

> Artificial neural networks and deep learning AI technologies are evolving rapidly, primarily because AI processes large amounts of data much faster and makes more accurate predictions than humanly possible.
>
> While the huge volume of data created daily would bury a human researcher, AI applications that use machine learning can take that data and quickly turn it into actionable insights. As of this writing, the main drawback of using AI is that it is expensive to process the large amounts of data required for AI programming.

## **Strong AI vs Weak AI**

***AI can be categorized as weak or strong***.

* **Weak AI:**

> Also known as Narrow AI, is an AI system designed and trained to perform a specific task. Industrial robots and virtual personal assistants, such as Apple's Siri, use weak AI.

---

* **Strong AI :**

> Also known as artificial general intelligence (AGI), describes programming capable of replicating the cognitive abilities of the human brain. When faced with an unknown task, a powerful AI system can use fuzzy logic to apply knowledge from one domain to another and find a solution on its own. In theory, a strong AI program should be able to pass both a Turing test and the Chinese hall test.

## **What are the 4 types of artificial intelligence?**

![ AI type](assets/index.jpeg)

> Arend Hintze, assistant professor of integrative biology and computer science and engineering at Michigan State University, explained in a 2016 article that AI can be categorized into four types, starting with task-specific intelligent systems widely used today and progressing towards sensitive systems. , which do not yet exist. The categories are as follows:

---

* **Type 1: Reactive machines:**

> These AI systems have no memory and are task specific. An example is Deep Blue, the IBM chess program that beat Garry Kasparov in the 1990s. Deep Blue can identify pieces on the board and make predictions, but since it has no memory, it cannot use past experiences to inform future ones.

---

* **Type 2: Limited memory:**

> These AI systems have memory, so they can use past experiences to inform future decisions. Some of the decision-making functions in self-driving cars are designed this way.

---

* **Type 3: Theory of Mind:**

> Theory of mind is a psychology term. Applied to AI, this means the system would have the social intelligence to understand emotions. This type of AI will be able to infer human intentions and predict behavior, a skill necessary for AI systems to become full members of human teams.

---

* **Type 4: Self-awareness:**

> In this category, AI systems have a sense of self, which gives them consciousness. Self-aware machines understand their own current state. This type of AI does not yet exist.

---

## **Why is artificial intelligence important?**

> AI is important because it can give companies insight into their operations that they may not have known before and because in some cases AI can perform tasks better than humans. Especially when it comes to repetitive and detailed tasks such as scanning a large number of legal documents to ensure that the relevant fields are filled in correctly, AI tools often perform the tasks quickly and with relatively few errors.
>
> This helped fuel an explosion in efficiency and opened the door to entirely new business opportunities for some large corporations. Before the current wave of AI, it would have been hard to imagine using computer software to connect riders to taxis, but today Uber has become one of the biggest companies in the world doing just that. It uses sophisticated machine learning algorithms to predict when people are likely to need rides in certain areas, helping to proactively get drivers on the road before they're needed.

## **What are examples of AI technology and how is it used today ?**

 ***AI is embedded in a variety of different types of technologies.***

**Here are six examples:**

![Auto](assets/auto.jpg)

* **Automating:**

> When combined with AI technologies, automation tools can increase the volume and types of tasks performed. One example is robotic process automation (RPA), a type of software that automates repetitive, rule-based data processing tasks traditionally performed by humans. When combined with machine learning and emerging AI tools, RPA can automate larger parts of business tasks, enabling tactical RPA bots to transmit AI insights and respond to process changes.

![vision](assets/vision.jpeg)

* **Artificial vision:**

> This technology gives a machine the ability to see. Computer vision captures and analyzes visual information using a camera, analog-to-digital conversion, and digital signal processing. It is often compared to human sight, but artificial vision is not related to biology and can be programmed to see through walls, for example. It is used in a range of applications from signature identification to medical image analysis. Computer vision, which focuses on computer image processing, is often confused with machine vision.
